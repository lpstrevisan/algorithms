# algorithms
This repository contains the exercises from the 2021.1 semester at the Federal University of Pernambuco.

In total, there were 6 exercises:
* [Queue and Stack](queue_and_stack/README.md) (Accepted)
* [Hash Table](hash_table/README.md) (Accepted)
* [AVL Tree](avl_tree/README.md) (Accepted)
* [Heap](heap/README.md) (7 out of 8 test cases)
* Graph (Not yet solved)
* Dynamic programming (Not yet solved)

All of them are hosted on [iudex.io](https://iudex.io/) where they can be found through the title name of their respective README.md

I intend to gradually add the solutions to this repository as I solve them and inform how many test cases have passed.
